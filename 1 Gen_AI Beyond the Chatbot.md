## Foundation of GenAI

- Foundation models are large AI models trained on enormous data sets. This broad training allows them to develop a deep understanding of the data and be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.
- They offer the potential to streamline processes, automate tasks, and unlock new possibilities across various business functions.
- Artificial intelligence (AI) is when computer systems perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language or making decisions. This is often achieved through machine learning (ML), where systems learn from data to solve specific problems.
- Traditionally, AI models were trained for a single purpose using specific data, like filtering spam emails from your inbox. Foundation models are different. They're trained on massive amounts of diverse data (text, images, and code), enabling them to adapt to many different tasks.
- LLMs or large language models are probably the most famous type of foundation model. They are a specialized type of foundation model that focuses specifically on language.
	
## Key features of foundation models
- Trained on diverse data: Foundation models are trained on a wide variety of data, allowing them to learn general patterns and relationships that can be applied to different tasks.
- Flexible: With foundation models, one AI model can support a wide range of use cases.
- Adaptable: Foundation models can be specialized for particular domains or use cases through additional, targeted training.
	
## Examples of foundation models
- Gemini: Trained on a massive dataset of text, images, code, audio, video, and more. This multimodal training allows Gemini to perform tasks across various domains, including language understanding, image generation, code generation, and more.
- Imagen: Trained primarily on a massive dataset of images and text descriptions. This enables Imagen to generate high-quality images from text descriptions, perform image editing tasks, and understand the content of images.
- Chirp : Trained on a large dataset of audio in various languages. Chirp is designed for speech recognition and can be used for tasks like voice assistants, transcription, and translation. Find information at the right time.
	
## Use case: Imagen in action
- PUMA, a global sports brand, partnered with Google Cloud to revolutionize its e-commerce product imagery. By leveraging Imagen, PUMA can now create high-quality images of their products in different settings, colors, and styles – all without the need for expensive photoshoots.
- This approach not only saves time and resources, but also allows for greater flexibility and creativity in showcasing their products online. The result is a more engaging and personalized shopping experience for PUMA's customers, driving sales and brand loyalty.
	
## Prompting models

1. How are foundation models used for gen AI?
	- Foundation models, like other AI models, take in inputs, which are called prompts, to produce outputs.
	- While all AI models have inputs or prompts, foundation models are usually much more flexible in what you can prompt. For example, some AI models have strict requirements on the type of inputs they can handle. They may only handle numbers, emails, or images.
	- Foundation models, and especially multimodal foundation models, can take in a much broader set of inputs.
	
2. Prompting inputs and outputs
- What are these inputs and outputs? It might be easier to understand with some examples.

|          Input (prompt)	                         |        Output                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Question	                                         |   The answer to the question		|
| Request for an image based on a text description   |   The image						|
| Request a summary of a file	                     |   The file summary				|
| Sample code with errors	                         |   Corrected code with no errors	|
